left,Kazimir Malevich ,Russian artist,"Kazimir Malevich is a key conceptual influence for my web design workbook where he is known for using geometric forms such as squares, circles, and lines in his artworks. His minimalist compositions and bold structural layouts inspire my approach into creating a futuristic yet graphic heavy design for my workbook’s visual outlook. The use of strong grid systems could be a good referencing point for visual hierarchy that can be adapted into the layout for my front cover page with a title, shapes and text scattered across the page. The contrast in his colour palettes with primary with monochrome colours can help create a technical feel in my workbook alongside with a sense of motion, potentially animated gif, to draft up a design layout and content for project 2A.

left,Cyberpunk ,Conceptual theme idea,"The cyberpunk aesthetic plays a significant role in the visualisation and shaping the theme of my web design workbook for project 2A. Delving into the concept of sci-fi and futurism, it explores a world of developing technology where the design will incorporate high-tech visuals, human-machine interface elements and extracting vibrant neon colours into the web pages. The aesthetic features bright green, yellow and black combination to evoke the feel of digital coding. In addition, adding graphic distortion with glitches in the background animating to create a nice layering effect to enhance the futuristic atmosphere and showcasing the content of the week with research work.",https://a-g-i.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/GötzGramlich/_1600xAUTO_crop_center-center_75_none/gggrafik_cyberpunk.jpg,,Cyberpunk graphic poster,,https://a-g-i.org/design/cyberpunk-experience,"Glitch, Cyberpunk, Neon",
left,NGV French Impressionist exhibition,Spatial idea,"In 2021, the National Gallery of Victoria held an exhibit of French Impressionism artworks featuring artist such as Claude Monet, Pierre etc. The surrounding space for one of the exhibits features a bold use of blue and green to create a dramatic contrast when entering that inspires my project 2A to follow a similar approach of using striking colour palettes. These colours can help draw attention to the content that can be present across the weekly web pages. Another specialty is the geometric layout of the exhibition space where the middle space is a square split that forms triangles in different colours that gives a unique statement to the work. The project 2A could introduce triangular shapes as a repetitive decorative element spreaded across the pages with addition to white surrounding space, like the exhibition, to highlight information with an artistic visual outlook.",https://cdn.broadsheet.com.au/cache/12/3c/123c8dde56e5ecaee8845aa1c5025c3f.jpg,,"National Gallery of Victoria, French Impressionism exhibition space, 2021",,https://www.broadsheet.com.au/national/event/french-impressionism-ngv-virtual-tour,"Space, Contrast, Shape",
left,Yayoi Kusama,Japanese artist ,"Yayoi Kusama is a major conceptual influence on my web design workbook for Project 2B as we conducted studies on her across week 4-5 and a visit to her recent NGV exhibition. She is well known for her immersive installations and interactive art where she utilises bright colours and repetitive patterns which are all present in her iconic works like Polka Dot Obsession and Infinity Mirror Rooms that inspires the visual direction for my second web design workbook. There was a mirror room installation with glowing neon tones that inspires my web pages to follow similar visuals as well as her signature polka dots that can be a key design motif which I plan to animate interactivity that floats across the screen, enhancing motion and immersion for users to engage with.",https://www.icaboston.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/dsc05916-930x620.jpg,,"National Gallery of Victoria, Yayoi Kusama, Infinity Mirror Room, 2025",,https://www.icaboston.org/exhibitions/yayoi-kusama-love-calling/,"Neon lights, Polka dots, Repetition",
left,Daniel Arsham,American visual artist,"Daniel Arsham’s ‘Falling Clock’, featured in NGV Triennial 2020 is another conceptual influence for project 2B web design workbook. He is known for his unique blend of architecture and sculpture work where Arsham’s work evokes a poetic exploration of time decay and futurism which is the concept explored in project 2A that I will continue to follow through. This theme also resonates with the cyberpunk and a hint of cyborg aesthetic where it can influence my project 2B to create a cohesive flow with the first project through monochromatic palette. I could possibly incorporate a subtle glitch animation or effect in the background to suggest the fragmentation of time along with passing of time for technology for the main theme and additionally adding Kusama inspired polka dots behind the scenes to create a dynamic interactive webpage.",https://content.ngv.vic.gov.au/retrieve.php?size=1280&type=image&vernonID=145029,,"National Gallery of Victoria, Daniel Arsham, Falling Clock, 2020",,https://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/explore/collection/work/145029/,"Contemporary, Fragment of time, Minimalist",
left,teamLab,Artist collective space,There is a famous interactive installation at TeamLab that features a digital aquarium where visitors can draw their own fish on a paper that can be projected onto the big screen alongside with other drawings that features an engaging activity for many. This resonates with the direction of my web design workbook where it follows an interactive media that incorporates user driven elements where project 2B could potentially feature hover effects or screen changes based on user input using p5js. One of the p5js tutorials delves into doodling on the screen that can be incorporated into one of the content pages as it is a similar approach to the interactive exhibition. Another idea could be to include an animated ocean background as one of the content pages and having floating or drawn content behind the scenes to evoke digital immersion.,https://team-lab.imagewave.pictures/n3JtkAHK3tr8mbD4VGgguH?width=3840&quality=30,,"teamLab, Interactive Digital Installation, Hideaki Takahashi, 2013",,https://www.teamlab.art/ew/aquarium/,"Interactive art, Drawing projection",
left,Can't help myself,Artwork,Sun Yuan and Peng Yu’s ‘Can’t help myself’ is a significant reference to the themes explored in project 2C through the context of physical computing. This is one of the most iconic works of physical computing that features a robotic arm trapped in a transparent box where the arm endlessly attempts to prevent liquid from spilling and spread beyond boundary through sensors and motions. This explores concepts of exhaustion from decaying over time which is an idea that resonates with previous project conceptions with futurism in mind. The artwork is through a built mechanic robot with lines of code to operate that follows similar activities with the workshop in Telstra Creator Space that combines physical build of Arduino set up connecting to the laptop for inserting coding to operate. This could influence my third project to increased interactivity and thematic storytelling and potentially having one of the weekly pages to include visual elements such as red liquid referencing from the work to drip down across the web page.,https://images-prod.dazeddigital.com/900/azure/dazed-prod/1340/9/1349301.jpg,,"Can't Help Myself, Sun Yuan and Peng Yu, Artwork, 2016",,https://www.dazeddigital.com/art-photography/article/55253/1/dystopian-robot-arm-taking-over-tiktok-what-does-it-really-mean-cant-help-myself,"Robot, Physical computing, Motion sensor",
left,Chindogu,Inventions,"Chindogu is a Japanese concept that means useless inventions which is one of the key conceptual influences for Project 2C where the inventions are made to serve a purpose, but the impractical execution makes it humorous over the usability of the product. An example would be the noodle cooler attached to the chopsticks or the 360-angle head mounted camera designed to capture the perfect photo angle. These examples blur the line between creativity and functionality that could potentially be final project ideas if attempting to focus on physical computing instead of web-based design. As for the influence for my web design workbook, including playful animated interactions or moving elements create with p5js can bring a quirky and fun page for users to engage with which could incorporate elements from workshops such as the Arduino set up.",https://theculturemap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/chindogu-inventions.jpg,,Chindogu inventions,,https://theculturemap.com/chindogu-only-in-japan-things-exist/,"Inventions, Functionality, Creativity",
left,Pac Man costume,Real life physical computing,"This is a story of how a family who loves Halloween decided to dress up as Pac-Man ghosts where the father came up with a creative idea to make an interactive costumer using physical computing. In the journal, he showed his process of the making of the costumer with the use of Arduino setup with wiring, blinkers and coded commands that brings the concept to life. This example demonstrates how physical computing come to life and how it can be applied to everyday life (real world contexts). This work is applied to my research influence in Project 2C where it follows the workshop activities of using Arduino coding and blinkers to create a circuit. This becomes a strong reference for my hunt and gather and will be included in one of the weekly pages.",https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*GrF29Kuw3NeZEDezm1-sqg.jpeg,,"Pac Man LED costume, Arduino physcial computing",,https://medium.com/critical-making-2019/physical-computing-6c0112a6a2da,"Arduino coding, LED blinkers, Physical Computing",
left,Rain Room,Immersive space,"The Rain room is a popular experience in Melbourne that features an innovative use of physical computing where motion sensors detect human movement in a space where water is pouring down from the ceiling like rain and when people walked through, the rain will pause that creates an illusion of walking through the rain without getting wet. This immersive installation combines both motion and sound sensor to create the immersive experience that is also explored through workshop class activities for Project 2C. As for the web page, there could be animated raindrops falling in the background and having the mouse moving across will create a barrier where the rain will reflect and not touch on the mouse cursor to reflect the rain room concept, if possible to achieve through p5js and html, that could be a creative idea for the visual outlook of project 2C.",https://jackalopehotels.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rain_Room-1924x1250-1-1.jpg,,"Jackalope hotels, Rain Room, 2023",,https://jackalopehotels.com/art/rainroom,"Immersive space, Motion sensor, Sound sensory",
